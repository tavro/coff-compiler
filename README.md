# coff-compiler
a simple compiler written in c

for now, the compiler translates given infix to expected postfix.

## compile
compile the compiler by running <code>cc main.c</code> on your UNIX os

## running
run <code>./a.out</code> and input your desired program (or in this case infix), for example <code>(1+2)+3;</code>

## output
the compiler will output the expected postfix token by token separated by new lines
